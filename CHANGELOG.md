## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-30 — B9: Training Data Poisoning Detection (W195)

### Added

- **`squash/data_poison.py`** — six-layer training data poisoning scanner (W195 / B9):

  **Layer 1 — Threat Intelligence** (`ThreatIntelChecker`)
  Cross-references dataset file hashes against a curated registry of known-poisoned
  and known-compromised datasets. Definitive detection with zero false positives on
  a match. Seed set covers Badnets SST-2, Hidden Killer clean-label, and documented
  HuggingFace supply-chain incidents.

  **Layer 2 — Label Integrity** (`LabelIntegrityChecker`)
  Shannon entropy analysis, class imbalance ratio (flagged at >50x), and per-class
  Z-score spike detection (flagged at z > 4). Reads CSV/TSV/JSONL label files.
  Label-flipping attacks always leave an entropy signature detectable by this layer.

  **Layer 3 — Duplicate Injection Detection** (`DuplicateDetector`)
  SHA-256 content-hash duplicate rate per file. Adversarial sample amplification
  (inserting the same poisoned sample N times) is flagged at >5% duplicate rate
  (MEDIUM) and >20% (HIGH). Covers JSONL, CSV, TSV, and plain text.

  **Layer 4 — Statistical Outlier Detection** (`OutlierDetector`)
  Z-score analysis on numerical feature columns (threshold z > 5). Adversarially
  crafted inputs lie off the data manifold and are extreme outliers. Constant
  columns (synthetic data indicator) are also flagged. Numpy-accelerated with
  stdlib `statistics` fallback for air-gapped environments.

  **Layer 5 — Backdoor Trigger Pattern Scan** (`TriggerPatternScanner`)
  Searches for 9 known NLP backdoor trigger tokens (Badnets `cf`, Hidden Killer
  `mn`, instruction-tuning poison `tq`, zero-width space, BOM markers, GPT special
  tokens). Also detects Unicode homoglyph character mixing (Latin + Cyrillic/Greek
  in the same token — the invisible-trigger attack class from Boucher et al. 2022).

  **Layer 6 — Provenance Chain Integrity** (`ProvenanceIntegrityChecker`)
  Flags missing provenance records, file modification timestamps post-dating claimed
  creation dates, and suspicious source URL patterns (Mega.nz, Pastebin, anonfiles,
  darkweb/onion domains).

  **Aggregation** — weighted risk score → `CLEAN / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL`.
  CRITICAL check hit immediately elevates report regardless of aggregate score.
  Prioritised remediations generated per flagged layer.

- **CLI: `squash data-poison`** — 2 subcommands:
  - `scan <dataset_path> [--format text|json|md] [--out PATH] [--fail-on low|medium|high|critical] [--provenance PATH]`
  - `report <report.json>` — render a previously saved report
- **`tests/test_data_poison.py`** — 39 tests covering all six layers, end-to-end
  clean/poisoned datasets, JSON round-trip, Markdown render, and CLI smoke.
  Module count gates updated (71→72); full suite clean.

- Turner et al. 2019 — Label-Consistent Backdoor Attacks
- Shafahi et al. 2018 — Poison Frogs! Targeted Clean-Label Poisoning Attacks
- Schwarzschild et al. 2021 — Just How Toxic Is Data Poisoning?
- Wan et al. 2023 — Poisoning Language Models During Instruction Tuning
- Boucher et al. 2022 — Bad Characters: Imperceptible NLP Attacks
- OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 — LLM04: Data and Model Poisoning

### Konjo notes

- 건조 — pure stdlib core; numpy optional for Layer 4. No model execution, no
  network calls, no daemons. Safe in FedRAMP / CMMC air-gapped environments.
- 根性 — six independent detection layers means no single bypass defeats the
  scanner. An attacker who avoids layer 3 (dedup) still faces layers 2 and 5.
- 康宙 — the scanner is a read-only pass over existing dataset artefacts.
  No data is copied, modified, or sent anywhere.
- কুঞ্জ — the report is a portable JSON document that an ML security team can
  run as part of CI, attach to a model card, and hand to an auditor. Every
  finding includes a reference to the underlying paper or standard.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-30 — B7: Drift SLA Certificate (W194)

### Added

- **`squash/drift_certificate.py`** — Drift SLA Certificate generator (W194 / Tier 3 B7):
  - `DriftSLASpec` — typed SLA contract: model, framework, min_score, window_days,
    max_violation_rate, min_snapshots, org. Input validation on all parameters.
  - `ScoreLedger` — append-only JSONL ledger of compliance score snapshots per model per
    framework. Populated from `master_record.json` files via `ingest()` or directly via
    `add_snapshot()`. Supports time-window, model, and framework filtering.
  - `SLAEvaluator` — computes SLA result over a ledger slice: passes/fails, compliance
    rate, score stats (min/max/avg/p10), violation count, contiguous violation windows.
    Mathematically exact: violation rate is per-snapshot, not per-calendar-day bucket.
  - `ViolationWindow` — contiguous run of below-threshold snapshots with min score.
  - `DriftCertificate` — signed certificate envelope with `squash.drift.certificate/v1`
    schema marker; `body_dict()` produces the canonical signed surface (excludes sig/key);
    `to_markdown()`, `to_html()`, `to_json()` renderers; HTML is print-ready for PDF via
    weasyprint.
  - `DriftCertificateIssuer` — signs certificates with Ed25519 (same keypair as
    `LocalAnchor`); public key embedded in envelope; `verify()` detects tampered spec,
    tampered result, unknown schema, and unsigned certs.
  - `load_certificate()` — round-trip JSON deserialiser.
  - `SQUASH_DRIFT_LEDGER` env var for CI/air-gap ledger path override.
- **CLI: `squash drift-cert`** — 5 subcommands:
  - `ingest <master_record.json>` — append snapshot to ledger
  - `issue --model --framework --min-score --window [--priv-key] [--out] [--format]`
  - `verify <cert.json>` — signature + self-consistency check
  - `show <cert.json>` — human-readable Markdown render
  - `export <cert.json> --format md|html|pdf` — export certificate
- **`tests/test_drift_certificate.py`** — 30 tests:
  - DriftSLASpec validation (invalid score, window, rate, min_snapshots)
  - ScoreLedger: add/query, model filter, time-window filter, master_record ingest
  - SLAEvaluator: all-pass, violation-rate exceeded, within-budget, insufficient
    snapshots, no snapshots, violation windows, score statistics
  - DriftCertificate: body_dict excludes signature, JSON round-trip, Markdown/HTML render
  - DriftCertificateIssuer: sign+verify roundtrip, tampered spec fails, tampered result
    fails, unsigned cert → false, unknown schema → false
  - Env-var override; CLI parser registration; end-to-end ingest→issue→verify

### Konjo notes

- 건조 — the SLA evaluation is a pure function over the ledger; no network, no daemon,
  no background worker. The ledger is a single JSONL file.
- ᨀᨚᨐᨚ — `violation_rate = violations / snapshots` is computed to full float precision,
  not rounded to a daily bucket. A certificate is wrong or it is right — no rounding mode.
- 康宙 — the ledger is append-only; certificates are issued on-demand from history.
  Tamper detection is a first-class property: changing any field in the certificate body
  breaks the Ed25519 signature immediately.
- কুঞ্জ — a Drift SLA Certificate is the artefact an insurance underwriter, enterprise
  procurement team, or board-level CISO can actually hold. "Model M stayed above 80/100
  on EU AI Act for 90 days, signed, verifiable." That is the garden squash builds for
  the next person.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-30 — B6: Audit-Trail Blockchain Anchoring (W193)

### Added

- **`squash/anchor.py`** — Merkle-tree audit-trail anchoring (W193 / Tier 3 #29):
  - `MerkleTree` — domain-separated (RFC 6962) binary Merkle tree; pure stdlib SHA-256;
    odd-level duplicate-tail to prevent phantom-node attacks; O(n) build, O(log n) proof.
  - `MerkleProof` — frozen, self-contained inclusion proof that verifies with stdlib only;
    no squash code, no network, no trust in the issuer beyond holding their public key.
  - `LocalAnchor` — Ed25519 signature over `root || leaf_count || timestamp`;
    public key embedded in the anchor record so verifiers need no separate key fetch;
    works in air-gapped / FedRAMP environments; signing payload is canonical JSON.
  - `OpenTimestampsAnchor` — submits Merkle root to the Bitcoin-backed OTS aggregator
    network; produces a `.ots` file; verification via `ots verify` at a Bitcoin node.
  - `EthereumAnchor` — posts root as EVM calldata (`0x73717368` magic + 32-byte root +
    uint64 leaf_count) via Foundry `cast`; chain-agnostic (mainnet, Base, Optimism, Polygon);
    verifiable by anyone with `cast tx <hash> input`.
  - `AnchorLedger` — append-only JSONL ledger (`~/.squash/anchor/`); stage→commit→verify
    workflow; `export_proof()` emits a portable, self-contained `squash.anchor.proof/v1`
    doc that a third party can verify with 30 lines of stdlib Python.
  - `canonical_json()` + `hash_attestation()` — deterministic attestation hashing;
    two organisations producing semantically identical attestations get bit-identical hashes,
    enabling cross-organisation verification.
  - `verify_proof()` — standalone reference verifier; the auditor's side of the protocol.
- **CLI: `squash anchor`** — 6 subcommands:
  - `add <master_record.json>` — stage into pending batch
  - `commit --backend local|opentimestamps|ethereum` — build Merkle root + anchor
  - `verify <attestation_id>` — Merkle inclusion + backend witness check
  - `proof <attestation_id> [--out PATH]` — emit portable proof JSON
  - `list` — all committed anchors (ANSI + `--json`)
  - `status` — pending batch + last anchor
- **`tests/test_anchor.py`** — 23 tests:
  - Canonical hashing: key-order invariant, whitespace-free, Unicode-stable
  - Merkle tree: 1-leaf, 2-leaf, 3-leaf (odd), 50-leaf; all proofs verify
  - Tampered leaf / tampered root / tampered path → FAIL
  - LocalAnchor sign/verify roundtrip; tampered root → FAIL
  - AnchorLedger stage → commit → per-attestation verify
  - Cross-instance durability (fresh reader after writer commits)
  - Portable proof verified by `verify_proof()` with no ledger access
  - Post-anchor record tamper: anchored proof still holds; new hash diverges (tamper detection)
  - Empty-batch commit raises; multi-commit ordering preserved
  - `SQUASH_ANCHOR_DIR` env override; CLI subcommand registration; status on empty ledger

### Konjo notes

- 건조 — the cryptographic construction (domain-separated Merkle, canonical JSON, embedded
  public key) strips to the essential invariants. No blockchain SDK dependency; the only
  external dep for the local backend is `cryptography`, already in the squash tree.
- ᨀᨚᨐᨚ — a portable proof is a single JSON file. Any auditor can carry it to any machine
  and verify with stdlib hashlib + cryptography. No squash code required, no network call,
  no trust in the issuer beyond their public key.
- 康宙 — the ledger is append-only. Compromises are new entries, never rewrites.
  No goroutines, no daemons, no background workers.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-30 — B4: Terraform / Pulumi Provider

### Added — Tier 3 #26 (B4) Terraform/Pulumi provider

- **`integrations/terraform/`** — full Terraform provider in Go, built on
  `terraform-plugin-framework` v1.13.0:
  - `squash_attestation` resource — runs `squash attest`, captures the
    master record JSON, exposes `attestation_id`, `overall_score`,
    `passed`, `framework_scores`, SBOM/signature paths. Replacement on
    `model_path` change preserves an immutable provenance trail.
  - `squash_policy_check` resource — declarative compliance gate; fails
    `terraform apply` when score drops below `min_score` or when
    `require_passed = true` and the upstream attestation did not pass.
    Lets a regression block every dependent resource via the dependency
    graph (no admission controller required).
  - `squash_compliance_score` data source — read an existing
    `master_record.json` without re-running the pipeline; surfaces
    `top_frameworks` for compact downstream gating.
  - Provider config: `cli_path`, `models_dir`, `policy`, `api_key`
    (sensitive), `offline` — every field has an env-var fallback for
    CI/air-gap parity.
  - **`internal/squashcli/`** — stdlib-only core (zero external deps).
    Argv builder + master-record JSON parser + injectable `Runner`
    interface. Tested offline; the package the FedRAMP / CMMC story
    rests on.
  - 7 squashcli tests + 9 provider schema/helper tests = 16 Go tests
    passing under `go test -race -count=1`.
  - Build: `make build` / `make install` / `make test` / `make test-core`.
- **`integrations/terraform/pulumi/`** — Pulumi parity:
  - `examples/typescript` and `examples/python` show the
    `@pulumi/command` shell-out pattern that works today.
  - README documents the Pulumi Terraform bridge path for strongly-typed
    multi-language SDKs once the provider is published to the Registry.
- **Examples** (`integrations/terraform/examples/`):
  - `basic` — single model, signed, gated.
  - `multi-model-gate` — `for_each` over a model registry.
  - `data-source-gate` — gate a deploy on a CI-produced record.
- **Registry-format docs** under `integrations/terraform/docs/`:
  `index.md`, `resources/attestation.md`, `resources/policy_check.md`,
  `data-sources/compliance_score.md`.
- **`integrations/terraform/terraform-registry-manifest.json`** —
  protocol v6 manifest for Terraform Registry publication.

### Konjo notes

- 건조 (dry): provider is a typed declarative facade — zero duplicate
  SBOM/policy logic. The squash CLI remains the single source of truth.
- ᨀᨚᨐᨚ (seaworthy): stdlib-only core means the provider can be audited
  and shipped to air-gapped environments without a HashiCorp dep tree
  audit on the critical path.
- 康宙 (health of the universe): one process per `terraform apply`, no
  goroutines, no daemons, no background workers.

---

## [0.9.13] — 2026-04-28 — Sprint 3: CI/CD & Integrations

### Added (W145–W152 — Sprint 3: CI/CD & Integrations)
- **`action.yml`** — GitHub Actions composite action v1.0 (W145):
  - Inputs: `model-path` (required), `policies`, `sign`, `fail-on-violation`, `api-key`, `output-dir`, `annex-iv`, `squash-version`.
  - Outputs: `passed`, `score`, `artifacts-dir`, `bom-digest`.
  - Steps: `actions/setup-python@v5`, pip install squash-ai, `squash attest`, optional Annex IV generation, `actions/upload-artifact@v4` (90-day retention).
  - Marketplace branding: icon=`shield`, color=`blue`.
- **GitHub Actions marketplace metadata** (W146):
  - All inputs/outputs documented with descriptions; all optional inputs have defaults.
  - Stable action version refs; `@main` refs explicitly forbidden by test gate.
- **`integrations/gitlab-ci/squash.gitlab-ci.yml`** — GitLab CI template (W147):
  - Three job variants: `.squash_attest` (base), `.squash_attest_soft` (allow_failure), `.squash_attest_full` (sign + Annex IV + multi-policy).
  - Variables: `SQUASH_POLICIES`, `SQUASH_SIGN`, `SQUASH_FAIL_HARD`, `SQUASH_ANNEX_IV`, `SQUASH_VERSION`, `SQUASH_OUTPUT_DIR`.
  - Artifacts with 90-day expiry; `squash_result.json` always saved.
- **`integrations/jenkins/vars/squashAttest.groovy`** — Jenkins shared library step (W148):
  - `squashAttest(modelPath:, policies:, sign:, failOnViolation:, outputDir:, annexIv:, squashVersion:, apiKey:)`.
  - `withCredentials()` for API key; `readJSON` for result parsing; `unstable()` on violation.
  - Stashes attestation artifacts (`squash-attestation`) for downstream stages.
- **`.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`** — GHCR Docker image publish workflow (W149):
  - Triggers: release published, push to main (squash/**, Dockerfile, pyproject.toml), `workflow_dispatch`.
  - Tags: `latest`, branch, semver major/minor, SHA short.
  - Concurrency guard; post-push health verification via `docker run`.
  - Uses `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (no PAT required).
- **`integrations/kubernetes-helm/`** — Helm chart for Kubernetes admission controller (W150):
  - `Chart.yaml`: apiVersion v2, type application, appVersion 0.9.14.
  - `values.yaml`: replicaCount=2, image=`ghcr.io/konjoai/squash`, webhook.port=8443, failurePolicy=Ignore, excludeNamespaces=[kube-system], policies=[eu-ai-act], podSecurityContext.runAsNonRoot=true.
  - `templates/deployment.yaml`: liveness+readiness probes on /health, TLS cert volume mount, SQUASH_API_TOKEN from secret ref.
  - `templates/service.yaml`: ClusterIP on 443 → 8443.
  - `templates/validatingwebhookconfiguration.yaml`: admissionReviewVersions=[v1], namespaceSelector exclusions, cert-manager annotation support.
  - `templates/_helpers.tpl`, `templates/serviceaccount.yaml`, `templates/rbac.yaml`.
- **Real MLflow SDK bridge validation** (W151):
  - `squash/integrations/mlflow.py` — `MLflowSquash.attest_run()` fully wired: `AttestPipeline.run()` → `mlflow.log_artifacts()` → `mlflow.set_tags()` with `squash.*` namespace tags.
  - Tags: `squash.passed`, `squash.scan_status`, per-policy `squash.policy.<name>.passed/errors`.
  - `output_dir` defaults to `model_path.parent / "squash"`.
- **218 new tests** across W145–W152 test files. **Sprint 3 complete: 218/218 tests passing.**
- **Bug fixes** (pre-existing, fixed in Sprint 3 cycle):
  - `squash/model_card.py`: `datetime.UTC` → `datetime.timezone.utc` (Python 3.10 compat, caused 17+ test failures).
  - `squash/api.py`: `datetime.UTC` → `datetime.timezone.utc` in `_ts_now()`; `Retry-After` header added to IP-rate-limit 429 responses.
  - `tests/test_squash_model_card.py`: path fixed from `squish/squash` → `squash`, module count updated to 47; `squish.squash.cli` → `squash.cli` in CLI subprocess tests.

### Added (W137–W144 — Sprint 2: Cloud API & Auth)
- **`squash/auth.py`** — DB-backed API key management (W137):
  - `KeyStore`: thread-safe in-memory + optional SQLite persistence; SHA-256 key hashing (never plaintext).
  - `KeyRecord`: plan-aware `monthly_quota`, `rate_per_min`, `quota_remaining`.
  - `generate()`, `verify()`, `revoke()`, `update_plan()`, `increment_attestation_count()`, `reset_quota()`.
  - `POST /keys` (create), `DELETE /keys/{key_id}` (revoke) HTTP endpoints.
  - Module singleton `get_key_store()` / `reset_key_store()` for test isolation.
- **`squash/rate_limiter.py`** — Per-key plan-based sliding-window rate limiter (W138):
  - Limits: free=60, pro=600, enterprise=6000 req/min.
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit` / `X-RateLimit-Remaining` response headers on every authenticated request.
  - Middleware rewritten: legacy `SQUASH_API_TOKEN` still works as ops bypass; DB keys take priority.
- **`Dockerfile` + `fly.toml` + `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** — Fly.io deployment (W139):
  - Multi-stage Python 3.12 slim build, non-root `squash` user, port 4444, Docker HEALTHCHECK.
  - Fly.io: `iad` region, 256MB RAM, auto-stop, rolling deploy strategy.
  - GitHub Actions CD: test → fly deploy → health verify; `FLY_API_TOKEN` secret; `concurrency` guard.
- **`squash/postgres_db.py`** — PostgreSQL (Neon) cloud DB connector (W140):
  - `PostgresDB` with psycopg2, same interface as `CloudDB`; JSONB columns for tenant + event records.
  - `make_postgres_db()` factory reads `SQUASH_DATABASE_URL`; graceful SQLite fallback when absent.
  - DDL: `tenants`, `event_log` (with index), `api_keys` tables — all `IF NOT EXISTS`.
- **`squash/billing.py`** — Stripe subscription integration (W141):
  - `verify_stripe_signature()` — HMAC-SHA256 with 300s clock tolerance.
  - `StripeWebhookHandler`: `checkout.session.completed` (upgrade), `subscription.updated/deleted` (plan sync), `invoice.payment_failed` (no immediate downgrade).
  - `POST /billing/webhook` endpoint bypasses API key auth; Stripe-Signature verified internally.
- **`squash/quota.py`** — Monthly attestation quota enforcement (W142):
  - `QuotaEnforcer.check()` before pipeline; `consume()` after successful attestation.
  - `QuotaCheckResult` with `X-Quota-Used / Limit / Remaining` response headers.
  - `/attest` returns HTTP 429 with quota details when limit exhausted.
- **`GET /account/status` + `GET /account/usage`** — Authenticated account endpoints (W143):
  - Status: plan, key_id, tenant_id, quota_used/limit/remaining, rate_limit_per_minute, billing_period_start.
  - Usage: total_attestations, monthly_quota, quota_remaining for current billing period.
- **`squash/monitoring.py`** — Sentry error tracking + health endpoints (W144):
  - `setup_sentry()`: reads `SQUASH_SENTRY_DSN`, no-op when absent or `sentry-sdk` not installed.
  - `build_health_report()`: DB liveness probe, uptime, version, component status dict.
  - `GET /health/ping` → `"pong"` (Better Uptime monitor target).
  - `GET /health/detailed` → full health report; 503 when degraded. Both bypass auth.
- **Sprint 2 total: 251/251 tests. S1+S2 combined: 730/730 tests passing.**

### Added (W135 / W136 — Sprint S1 Exit Gate)
- `squash annex-iv generate` CLI command — Sprint S1 exit gate:
  - `--root DIR`: auto-discovers TensorBoard logs, training configs, Python scripts; runs full W128–W133 artifact extraction pipeline.
  - `--format md html json pdf`: selectable output formats (default: md json).
  - `--system-name`, `--version`, `--risk-level {minimal,limited,high,unacceptable}`: Annex IV §1(a) and §4 metadata.
  - `--mlflow-run`, `--wandb-run ENTITY/PROJECT/RUN_ID`, `--hf-dataset` (repeatable): optional cloud augmentation; all fail gracefully with warnings.
  - `--no-validate`, `--fail-on-warning`: pipeline-mode control.
- `squash annex-iv validate PATH`: reconstruct and re-validate any `annex_iv.json`; exit 2 on hard fail, 1 on warning (with `--fail-on-warning`).
- 68 new tests in `tests/test_squash_w135.py`.
- **Sprint S1 complete: 479/479 tests passing (W128–W135).**

### Added (Wave 133 + Wave 134)
- `squash/annex_iv_generator.py` — EU AI Act Annex IV document generator:
  - `AnnexIVGenerator.generate(result, *, system_name, version, ...)` — produces a complete 12-section `AnnexIVDocument` from `ArtifactExtractionResult` (W128-W132 outputs) + supplemental metadata kwargs.
  - 12 section renderers covering all Annex IV requirements: §1(a-c), §2(a-b), §3(a-b), §4, §5, §6(a-b), §7.
  - Per-section completeness scoring (0-100) weighted by legal importance: §1(c) and §2(a) carry 15/112 each; §7 carries 5/112.
  - Overall score = weighted sum across all sections; displayed with `✅ Full / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing` badges.
  - Article-specific gap statements (not generic "N/A") — every missing field names the exact Article and Annex IV section that requires it.
  - `AnnexIVDocument.to_markdown()` — human-readable, version-controllable, diff-friendly Markdown with header table, section badges, metric tables, code blocks.
  - `AnnexIVDocument.to_html()` — standalone HTML with embedded professional CSS (print-ready, dark branded header, score badge color-coded to compliance level). Falls back to minimal MD→HTML if `markdown` package absent.
  - `AnnexIVDocument.to_json()` — machine-readable export with all sections, completeness scores, gaps, and summary block.
  - `AnnexIVDocument.to_pdf(path)` — PDF via `weasyprint` (optional dep); raises `ImportError` cleanly when absent.
  - `AnnexIVDocument.save(output_dir, formats, stem)` — multi-format save; PDF failure silently skipped.
  - `AnnexIVValidator.validate(doc)` → `ValidationReport`: hard-fails on §1(a)/§2(a)/§3(a) below threshold; warnings on §3(b)/§5/§6(a)/overall; bias gap triggers Art. 10(2)(f) warning. `report.is_submittable` = no hard fails.
  - `ValidationReport.summary()` — one-line status string for CLI output.
- `tests/test_squash_w133.py`: 83 tests — badge thresholds, weighted scoring, all 12 sections full/empty/partial, Markdown structure, JSON roundtrip, HTML structure, save() multi-format, validator hard-fails and warnings, full pipeline integration.

### Added (Wave 132)
- `squash/code_scanner_ast.py` — new module (zero external deps, stdlib `ast` only):
  - `CodeArtifacts` dataclass — §1(c) evidence: imports, framework, optimizers, loss functions, model classes, data loaders, checkpoint ops, training loop patterns, requirements.

  - Data loader detection: `DataLoader`, `load_dataset`, `DataPipe`, `ImageFolder`, etc.
  - Training pattern detection: `model.fit`, `trainer.train`, `for epoch in range(...)` loop.
  - Model class detection: `from_pretrained()` calls + `model = SomeClass(...)` assignment heuristic.
- `ArtifactExtractor.from_training_script(path)` → `CodeArtifacts` wrapper.
- `ArtifactExtractor.from_training_directory(root)` → merged `CodeArtifacts` wrapper.
- `ArtifactExtractionResult.code: CodeArtifacts | None` field added; `is_empty()` updated; `to_annex_iv_dict()` emits `section_1c` from code when present (preferred over `TrainingConfig`).
