## ⚡ Brand Identity & Taglines

### The Primary Brand Line

> **"Squash violations, not velocity."**

This is the line. Four words. It captures the exact pain — compliance tools slow teams down, squash doesn't. Works on the homepage hero, conference badge, LinkedIn post opener, HN title. Every ML engineer who has watched a compliance process delay a release will feel it.

### Secondary Lines (Contextual Use)

| Context | Line |
|---------|------|
| Technical audiences (HN, Dev.to) | "Squash it in CI. Not in court." |
| Pricing page (below cost comparison) | "Squash the €35M fine." |
| GitHub README hero / paid ads | "Ship fast. Squash risk faster." |
| EU urgency / countdown clock | "Squash what the regulators find first." |
| Enterprise security buyer | "Squash the audit. Not your roadmap." |
| Conference talk opener | "Squash bugs, violations, and the €35M fine." |

### Product Identity

> Squash is the `pytest` of AI compliance. It runs in CI, it fails loudly, it produces machine-readable artifacts, and it integrates with the tools engineers already use.

That's the moat. Credo AI and OneTrust are form-filling tools. Squash is a pipeline primitive. Lean into this identity in all copy, the HN post, LinkedIn content, and design partner conversations.

**Market context update (April 2026):** The regulatory shift is structural, not cyclical. 75% of organizations will have formal AI governance frameworks by end of 2026 (up from <30% in 2023). The EU AI Act, Colorado AI Act (June 2026), SEC AI disclosure priority, and Italy's OpenAI GDPR fine confirm that regulators have crossed from intent to enforcement. They no longer want policy statements. **They want proof. Squash generates proof.**

**What's complete:** 90+ commits. v1.1.0. 56 Python modules. 3400+ tests across 5 completed sprints. Full engineering surface: Annex IV engine, ISO 42001 readiness, Trust Package exporter/verifier, OWASP Agentic AI Top 10, incident response, board report generator, cloud API + auth, CI/CD integration layer, Prometheus metrics, Slack/Teams/webhook notifications, JIRA/Linear/GitHub ticketing, FastAPI/Django compliance middleware, `squash demo`, `squash init`, `squash watch`, `squash install-hook`, shields.io-compatible badge SVG endpoint.

**What's not done yet:** PyPI publication, live Fly.io production deployment, website, domain, Stripe checkout links, onboarding emails, and the launch itself. Sprint 4A is the critical path.

## 🧭 Market Intelligence Update (April 2026)

### The Structural Shift

The AI compliance market is not a niche. It is a structural shift:
- **$340M → $4.83B by 2034** at 35–45% CAGR
- **75%+ of organizations** will have formal AI governance frameworks by end of 2026 (up from <30% in 2023)
- EU AI Act enforces **August 2, 2026** (95 days)
- Colorado AI Act enforces **June 2026**
- SEC elevated AI and cybersecurity to **top examination priorities** (displacing crypto)
- Italy fined OpenAI **€15 million** for GDPR violations in training data
- FTC ran **"Operation AI Comply"** targeting deceptive AI marketing
- Average enterprise runs **66 GenAI apps**, 65% without IT approval
- Shadow AI added **$670K** to average breach cost in 2025

### Unaddressed Pain Points Squash Must Own

| Pain | Solution | Wave | Priority |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| Vendor questionnaire nightmare (4-week manual process) | Trust Package + `squash verify-trust-package` | W171 ✅ | 🔥 Highest |
| AI vendor risk on buyer side (Shadow AI, 66 apps) | AI Vendor Risk Register (future) | W178 | High |
| Model sprawl documentation ("what AI do you have deployed?") | AI Asset Registry (future) | W179 | High |
| OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 (40% of apps will have agents by 2026) | Agent Audit | W172 ✅ | 🔥 First-mover |
| Training data GDPR liability (Italy fined OpenAI €15M) | Data Lineage Certificate (future) | W180 | High |
| ISO 42001 certification ($50K–$200K consultant market) | ISO 42001 Readiness | W170 ✅ | High |
| AI incident response (no tooling exists) | Incident Package | W173 ✅ | High |
| Board/CISO quarterly report (20-30 pages manual) | Board Report Generator | W174 ✅ | High |
| Bias audit (Workday lawsuit, NYC Local Law 144) | Bias Audit (future) | W181 | Medium-High |
| Annual AI system review (week-long manual process) | Annual Review Generator (future) | W182 | Medium |

### The Trust Registry Moat

Every company using squash publishing attestations to a public registry at `attestations.getsquash.dev` creates the **SSL Certificate Authority equivalent for AI compliance**. Buyers verify any vendor's posture by querying the registry — not by reading a 40-page questionnaire. The Sigstore signing infrastructure already exists. The registry is the product expression of it.

### Compliance-as-Code Identity

Squash's identity claim that no competitor owns: **compliance is a gate in your pipeline, not a form you fill out.** Credo AI and OneTrust sell to compliance teams. Squash sells to engineers. Engineers deploy it everywhere. Compliance teams watch the dashboard. This is the correct go-to-market motion and a fundamentally different distribution strategy than every incumbent.

---

## Part I: The Separation Decision

### Why Squash Is Its Own Repo ✅ COMPLETE

**1. Brand clarity.** Squish = Apple Silicon inference optimization. Squash = AI compliance platform for regulated enterprises. A CISO shopping for EU AI Act compliance tooling should never land on a repo full of INT4 quantization benchmarks.

**2. Licensing.** Squish runs under BUSL-1.1. Squash runs under Apache 2.0 (Community) + Commercial Enterprise. Open-sourcing the full compliance layer is a GTM weapon.

**3. Velocity.** Squash releases must happen independently. Enterprise customers cannot wait for a Squish SQUIZD format sprint to clear before getting their VEX feed update.

**4. Funding.** Investors will not fund a repo that also contains an Apple Silicon inference server.

**5. Hiring.** Squash engineers are compliance/platform/backend. Squish engineers are ML systems. Different interview loops, different cultures.

### Connection Between Squash and Squish

```
squish compress ./my-model --quant int4
    ↓ (produces model artifact)
squash attest ./my-model --policy eu-ai-act
    ↓ (compliance gate)
squash sign --model ./my-model
    ↓ (cryptographic provenance)
Deploy with confidence
```

## Part II: What Squash Actually Is

### The One-Sentence Pitch

**Squash automates EU AI Act compliance so ML teams spend engineering time building, not documenting.**

### The Problem It Solves (In Real Numbers)

- EU regulation could create a €17B–€38B compliance market by 2030
- Annual compliance expenses per AI system: up to €29,277 per company
- Non-compliance fines: up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover
- Documentation preparation: up to 40% of total assessment costs
- Manual Annex IV for a typical mid-market company: $150K–$400K/year

**Squash eliminates that overhead.**

### What Makes Squash Different

| Capability | Credo AI ($30–150K) | Vanta/Drata ($10–50K) | **Squash** |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|------------|
| AI-SBOM (CycloneDX ML-BOM) | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| EU AI Act Annex IV auto-generation | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| CI/CD native (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| MLflow / W&B integration | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| ModelScan security scanning | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| Sigstore signing + SLSA provenance | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| VEX feed (live vulnerability tracking) | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| Open-core (self-hostable) | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| Developer-first CLI | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ |
| Starting price | $30,000/yr | $10,000/yr | **$0/mo** |

### Domain
First choice: **squash.ai** | Fallback: **getsquash.dev** | Fallback: **squash.run**

### Hero Section

```
SQUASH

Automated EU AI Act Compliance
for ML Teams.

Squash generates your Annex IV documentation,
runs policy checks against 10+ frameworks, and
produces cryptographically signed audit records —
all inside your CI/CD pipeline.

[  Install CLI  ]    [  View Docs  ]    [  Book Demo  ]

⏰ EU AI Act high-risk enforcement: 96 days remaining
```

**The countdown clock is non-negotiable.** The deadline is real.

### Key Metrics Bar
```
4,200+ tests passing  |  10 policy frameworks  |  CycloneDX 1.7  |  SLSA Level 3
```

### The Problem (Pain → Cost)
```
Documentation preparation = 40% of total compliance cost
Manual Annex IV = 3–6 months engineering time
Missed deadline = up to €35M or 7% of global annual turnover

Your team didn't sign up to write compliance docs.
```

### How It Works (3 steps)
```
1. Install    pip install squash-ai
2. Attest     squash attest ./my-model --policy eu-ai-act
3. Ship       ✓ Annex IV generated · Policy: PASS · Signed
```

## Part VII-B: The Full Feature Roadmap (Ordered by Impact)

All 30 features ranked by acquisition impact, revenue leverage, and defensibility. The first 12 should be live before or at launch. Items 13–22 are Sprint 5–6. Items 23–30 are the 12-month enterprise moat.

### Tier 1 — Launch-Critical (before August 2, 2026)

| # | Feature | Module/Location | Impact |
|---|---------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | **`squash demo` command** | `squash/cli.py` + bundled sample model | Zero-friction first value. Run it, see a full attestation in 10 seconds. The "aha moment" command. Tweet the output. |
| 2 | **Compliance badge SVG endpoint** | `squash/api.py` `GET /badge/{framework}/{attestation_id}` | Installed-base virality. Every attested repo displays a badge = free marketing + social proof. shields.io compatible. |
| 3 | **`squash init` command** | `squash/cli.py` | Auto-detect ML framework (PyTorch/TF/MLflow/W&B/HF), scaffold `.squash.yml`, dry-run. Eliminates biggest onboarding friction. |
| 4 | **GitHub App** | GitHub Marketplace | Org-level install, auto-comments on PRs with compliance diff, blocks merge on policy fail. Acts as network effect: 1 user → 50 users at a company. |
| 5 | **Slack/Teams webhook** | `squash/notifications.py` | Drift alert, VEX CVE hit, CI fail → team channel. Makes squash part of daily operational rhythm. |
| 6 | **Browser-based playground** | Fly.io function + API | Paste HuggingFace ID or upload model.json, get full attestation in browser. Zero install. Converts README visitors. |
| 7 | **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** | `squash/metrics.py` + `api.py` | Enterprise platform teams live in Grafana. Squash becomes a dashboard tile, not a separate login. |
| 8 | **JIRA/Linear/GitHub Issues auto-ticketing** | `squash/ticketing.py` | Violation found → ticket auto-created with remediation steps. Closes the loop from "problem detected" to "work item created." |
| 9 | **FastAPI/Django compliance middleware** | `squash/middleware.py` | `from squash.middleware import ComplianceMiddleware`. 5 lines of code. Developer-led bottom-up growth. Adds `X-Squash-Attestation-ID` to inference response headers. |
| 10 | **`squash watch` mode** | `squash/cli.py` | Continuous drift detection in local dev. Model file changes → terminal notification. Builds the habit. |
| 11 | **Pre-commit hook** | `squash/cli.py` (`squash install-hook`) | `git pre-commit` runs attestation on model files. Compliance feedback at commit stage, not 15 min into CI. |
| 12 | **Direct HuggingFace Hub attestation** | `squash/cli.py` (`squash attest hf://`) | `squash attest hf://microsoft/phi-3`. Attest before downloading. Model procurement security scanner. |

### Tier 2 — Sprint 5–6 (August–September 2026)

| # | Feature | Module/Location | Impact |
|---|---------|----------------|--------|
| 13 | **VS Code extension** | Separate `squash-vscode` repo | Compliance status in sidebar. Engineers see squash daily without running a command. |
| 14 | **Public attestation registry** | `attestations.getsquash.dev` | Attestations published at shareable URLs. Verifiable by buyers, regulators, procurement. "npm audit" equivalent for AI. |
| 15 | **Model card auto-generation** | `squash/model_card.py` (already exists) | `squash model-card` as first-class CLI command. HF-compatible, pre-filled from Annex IV data. Required by HF for model publication. |
| 16 | **LangChain/LlamaIndex chain attestation** | `squash/integrations/langchain.py` | Attest entire RAG pipelines and agent chains. Multi-model pipeline compliance as a unit. |
| 17 | **SBOM diff command** | `squash/cli.py` (`squash diff v1 v2`) | Delta in compliance posture between model versions. Essential for model governance reviews. |
| 18 | **Model registry integrations** | `squash/integrations/` | Auto-attest on registration in MLflow/W&B/SageMaker Model Registry. Enforcement gate before production promotion. |
| 19 | **Startup pricing tier ($499/mo)** | Stripe + `squash/billing.py` | Captures seed/Series A segment. Too big for free, can't justify $899. 500 attestations, 3 users, VEX read, Slack. |
| 20 | **OpenTelemetry traces** | `squash/telemetry.py` | Every attestation run emits OTel spans. Integrates with Datadog, Honeycomb, Jaeger. Enterprise observability teams adopt immediately. |
| 21 | **ArgoCD/Flux GitOps integration** | `squash/integrations/gitops.py` | Block model deployment in GitOps pipeline if compliance score below threshold. |
| 22 | **Generic outbound webhook** | `squash/api.py` | Configurable webhook POSTing attestation events to any URL. PagerDuty, Opsgenie, ServiceNow, custom SOAR. One primitive, infinite connectors. |

### Tier 3 — 12-Month Enterprise Moat (September 2026–April 2027)

| # | Feature | Module/Location | Impact |
|---|---------|----------------|--------|
| 23 | **`squash scan hf://` public security scanner** | Free public tool | Anyone checks any HuggingFace model for security issues. Top-of-funnel brand builder. |
| 24 | **Branded PDF compliance report** | `squash/annex_iv_generator.py` (to_pdf() exists) | Cover page + exec summary. Email to the CISO. |
| 25 | **Compliance email digest** | `squash/notifications.py` | Weekly/monthly portfolio posture summary. Passive retention. |
| 26 | **Terraform/Pulumi provider** ✅ B4 (2026-04-30) | `integrations/terraform/` (Go, terraform-plugin-framework v1.13.0) — `squash_attestation` + `squash_policy_check` resources, `squash_compliance_score` data source, Pulumi `command` shell-out examples + bridge path documented. 16 Go tests passing under `-race -count=1`. | Compliance as infrastructure. DevOps teams adopt immediately. |
| 27 | **Pre-built HuggingFace Spaces deployment** | HF Spaces | Free, visible to entire HF community. Zero marketing cost. |
| 28 | **API gateway plugin** | Kong/AWS API Gateway | Block inference requests at runtime if attestation expired or CVE flagged. |
| 29 | **Audit trail blockchain anchoring** | `squash/provenance.py` | Ethereum OP_RETURN anchoring. Immutable proof for financial services/medical/defense. |
| 30 | **SOC 2 Type II** | Business/legal | Enterprise procurement unblocked. Start readiness phase now. |

---

### Strategic Rationale

Every feature in Tier 1 that puts squash in the developer's daily workflow (watch mode, pre-commit hook, IDE extension, Slack notifications) compounds into stickiness that makes churn nearly impossible.

Every feature that generates a shareable artifact (badge, PDF report, public attestation registry, branded model card) is free marketing.

Every feature that automates the ticket, the deployment gate, or the API block (GitHub App, JIRA integration, ArgoCD hook, API gateway plugin) turns squash from a tool into infrastructure. **Tools get replaced. Infrastructure doesn't.**

---

### The Design Partner Imperative

One named company using squash — even in closed beta — with a quote and a rough case study is worth more than any launch copy. Target: boutique AI consulting firms that build models for BFSI or healthcare and currently charge clients for compliance documentation. Squash turns that billable work into a 10-minute CLI run. They save the client money AND improve their own margins. That's the pitch.

**The case study headline:** "Reduced Annex IV documentation from 6 weeks to 15 minutes."

---

### The US Market Regulatory Angle

The master plan has been EU-focused. That's right for launch timing. But the parallel US narrative for US enterprise buyers:
- **NIST AI RMF** compliance for government contractors (already built in squash)
- **FedRAMP AI** for federal procurement (CMMC templates in squash)
- **SEC AI disclosure requirements** (materializing)
- **State AI bills** — Colorado, Illinois, Texas (emerging enforcement)

The US enterprise buyer who doesn't care about GDPR absolutely cares about a DoD contract. Surface FedRAMP/CMMC more aggressively in the website and sales materials.
